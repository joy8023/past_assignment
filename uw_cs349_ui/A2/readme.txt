There will be no jogs between two connected entities . So I didnâ€™t handle with the crossbar.
The entire diagram will zoom in or out around the upper left corner of the diagram. The entities may get overlapped when zooming in because some entities near the edge will be relocated.

Enhancement:
Renaming: double click on the entity in diagram to rename the entity.
Zoom button: there are two buttons to handle zooming of the diagram.
