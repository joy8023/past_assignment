The db.json file contains the required songs in the test, but I failed to save the rating and tags. I’ve tried many different method to implement this functionality but still didn’t make it. :(
Users can assign the rating and tags.
Search is not available actually.

The one enhancement is about to reducing the redundance of songs. The database can find the songs contained in the file and also in the users’ playlist, there would just combine the record and there would be just one record about this song.
