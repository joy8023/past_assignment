Features
1:Scoring: 1 line = 100pts,  2 lines  = 200pts, 3 lines = 400pts, 4 lines = 800pts.
2:the input sequence can be circulated when it runs out.

Enhancements
1:Next piece preview;
2:Sometimes pieces will need to be moved when rotated to avoid clipping out of the board (the I piece is a good example of this). Here I store a temporary row and column in case we need to move the tile as well. When a piece is too close to borders of the board it still can be rotated.

//PS:This tetris game can run in Intelli J with set a library path but I found that can not make in the command line with an exception and I have not figured out why this had happened…

then I searched for a new way to load the picture so I update some of my code on Oct. 3, just 20 minutes after the deadline…
